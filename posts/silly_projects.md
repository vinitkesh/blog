### I have worked on a lot of small tutorial projects or ideas that did or did not work out.

Here are some and what i learned from them.

## 1. Sahiti : Literary Fest Website

[Website](https://vinitkesh.github.io/Sahiti-frontend/#)

- Tried to built a website for the literary fest of LnD Club using pure HTML, CSS and JS. The website is not responsive and has a lot of bugs.
- The fest got cancelled.

## 2. Maanvric : Health Care

This was a project for a hackathon.

I wanted to build a health care app that would help people in rural areas to get health care services remotely.

Tried using existing health care APIs to build a health care app. The app was not completed. I tried to use and install Kotlin and Android Studio for the first time.

Thought I will learn app dev in that period of time and making somehting worhtwhile. But it was too much for me to handle.
