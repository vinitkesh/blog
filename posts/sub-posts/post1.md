## How a React Component Changed The Course My Life

> Yes, you read that right. A React component changed the course of my life.

In the January of 2024, I was a sophomore at the college. I was a part of the college's tech club [FOSSCell NITC](https://www.fosscell.org/) and we were working on preparations for [FOSSMeet'24](https://www.fossmeet.net/).


The seniors were developing it and i compelled one of them to add me in the group as well. A meeting was held on January 13th at 10AM, and everyone was assigned few components each. I was assigned the task of developing a simple card component that would display the event details. The catch was the stack they were using. They were using Next.js and Tailwind and I had never worked with it before. 

The senior incahrge was my role model and I wanted to impress him. I had to learn Next.js and Tailwind somehow and develop the component. And I decided to learn it OVERNIGHT. I started learning Next.js and Tailwind at 8PM and by 9AM, I had developed the component. I was so proud of myself.
A few weeks later, when I wanted to apply for Ragam Tech Team, I asked the head of GDSC Piyush if he could ask about the induction process. 

Although Ragam got cancelled due to protests and security concerns, I was asked by the GDSC Lead whether I would give a late induction. I was asked to make a website for a club DnD by th weekend. I did. And i was called for intervew. I went for the interview where i was asked questions about the website and the tech stack. I was techincal and general questions. After which, I was selected into the club.

The head of the Ragam tech team and the FOSSMeet website , Emanual Christo was impressed by my work and after a few months, by his decision i was appointed the web admin of CSEA. I was also appointed the Content Head of FOSSCell later due to my skills in writing and web development.

To summarise : A react component made me learn Next.js and Tailwind, which made me develop a website for GDSC, which made me get into GDSC, which made me CSEA Web Admin , which made me get into FOSSCell Content head.
