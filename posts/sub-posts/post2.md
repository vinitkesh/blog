## Wikipedia, Sharing Free and Open Source Knowledge


Before WikiPedia, Encyclodedia Britannica was the go-to source for information. But it was expensive and not everyone could afford it. Then came WikiPedia, a free and open source encyclopedia that anyone could edit. It was a revolution in the field of information sharing.

A lot of people may not know this, but wiki is completely open source and anyone can host their own wiki. And that's what we did at NITC. We hosted our own wiki at [wiki.fosscell.org](https://wiki.fosscell.org/). The NITC wiki was started in 2024 and was a small but definite success.


## Why does a college need a wiki?


![alt text](wiki-banner.png)


Colleges are dynamic abodes. NITC houses **6K+** students every year, and when their tenure ends, they take with them a lot of knowledge and experience. The wiki was started to document this knowledge and experience. From specific lingo, to the best places to eat, to the best places to study, to the best places to hangout. The wiki was supposed to be a one stop shop for all things NITC.

Recording history of NITC felt like an important task. And the wiki was supposed to be the place where it was done. I took up the task to write about as many tasks i could.



I started as a challenge to gain the top rank in the leaderboard. As the newly appointed Content Head at FOSS Cell, I took it personally to do what i preach. And from mid May, I started writing and editing articles on the wiki everyday. On 2nd June, i got to know about the Back to campus Wiki marathon and the grand prize of Rs. 2k + bonus .

I felt like I can not only fullfill the responsitbilities that i took upon my head but also win the prize. I was gaining positions every other day and I was soon eye to eye with Vyshakh, one of the mastermind behind the wiki and also the top contributor.


## The Future of NITC Wiki

Documentation of history and culture is an important and also a difficult task. The wiki is supposed to let the students know about the history of NITC, the culture of NITC and the people of NITC. It is supposed to be a place where the students can come and learn about the college and it's history. And make sure not to repeat the mistakes of the past. Maybe even learn from them.

The future of the wiki is uncertain. With the new batch of students coming in, the wiki will be updated with new information and new articles. The wiki will be a place where the students can come and learn about the college and it's history. And I hope that the wiki will continue to grow and become a valuable resource for the students of NITC.

We need more people to contribute to the wiki and even more people to read the wiki. But it is not going to be easy. It is going to take a lot of hard work and dedication to make the wiki a success. But I believe that it is possible. And I hope that the wiki will continue to grow and become a valuable resource for the students of NITC.
